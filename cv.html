			<h1>Benoît Grélard</h1>
			<h2>Lead frontend developer<br />London, UK / 35</h2>

			<p>
				I'm a lead web developer with 10+ years of experience focused on
				frontend. I have worked in various industries such as advertising,
				financial and startups. I love building great products with interesting
				data, beautiful UI and great UX.
			</p>

			<p>
				These days I specialize in building complex applications, often with
				lots of data, interactions and visualizations. My tools of choice are
				<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>,
				<a href="https://www.styled-components.com/">Styled Components</a>,
				<a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> and
				<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>.

			<h1>Profile</h1>

			<p>
				Whilst studying computer science, I always felt different. I cared
				deeply about the visual components of programming. After school, I would
				spend my nights learning about design, flash, 3D animations, etc.
				<strong
					>I started cultivating a passion for the web as I realised its
					inherent power and universality compared to any sort of native
					compiled application</strong
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time I got my master's degree, it was clear to me that I was
				going to work with web technologies. I went on to take a position at
				<a href="http://www.orange.com/">Orange</a> in Paris, as part of the R&D
				department working with frontend technologies to create cross platform
				widgets. It was not enough to fuel my
				<strong>passion for design</strong> too, so I decided to
				<strong>run my own company</strong> as well, working for clients like
				<a href="http://www.areva.com/">Areva</a>,
				<a href="http://www.monoprix.fr/">Monoprix</a> and
				<a href="http://www.carrefour.com/">Carrefour</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				After 3 years at Orange, <strong>I needed another challenge</strong>. I
				moved to London and accepted a frontend developer role at
				<a href="http://rga.com/">R/GA</a> where I had the opportunity to work
				on award winning projects for international brands such as
				<a href="http://www.pearson.com/">Pearson</a>,
				<a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">Beats by Dre</a>,
				<a href="http://www.nike.com/">Nike</a>,
				<a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/">O2</a> and
				<a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/">Getty Images</a> producing all
				sorts of high-end web-based solutions tailored to the client's needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				In late 2013, I took on yet another challenge and decided to create my
				own company and am now helping people to build successful web products.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am absolutely passionate about the web and
				<strong>I focus my expertise in frontend development</strong>. With over
				10 years experience in web development and great collaboration skills,
				notably with design and UX people,
				<strong>I am a solid addition to any team</strong>.

				finance. Users can experience new ways of doing financial analysis.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Full stack web developer (contract) / March 2019 – June 2019 / London
			</h3>
			<p>
				I helped Plural AI build the next generation of their product,
				introducing best practices in a brand new project. The main technologies
				involved were React/TypeScript/GraphQL/MongoDB.
			</p>

			<h2>Fathom</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://fath.om/">Fathom</a> are a UX consultancy making the
				business world’s most complex systems useful again through elegant
				interfaces and data visualisation.
			</p>
			<h3>Lead frontend developer / May 2016 – March 2019 / London</h3>
			<p>
				I joined Fathom full–time and led teams to help fintech companies, banks
				as well as startups build web apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				I led the build of a first–to–market realtime energy trading platform
				for <a href="https://www.bp.com/">BP</a>. The product includes a range
				of realtime elements like prices as well as charts. We leveraged
				<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
				<a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as core technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked with tech startup <strong>vFunction</strong> helping them
				create a product from scratch and craft an incredible experience for
				their users. The application was built with
				<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
				<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>. A few key aspects made the build
				quite challenging in terms of dataviz. I ended up creating a solution
				seemlessly mixing SVG and canvas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than client work, I spent a lot of time instigating a culture of
				code quality, testing, continuous integration, as well as mentored.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently working with market leaders to overhaul the US mortgage
				servicing industry by bringing it onto the blockchain. The project uses
				<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and

			</p>

			<h3>

				During my time at Fathom as a contractor, I helped build large-scale

				from admin software to realtime trading applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Notably, one of the projects I worked on for
				<a href="https://www.commerzbank.com/">Commerzbank</a> was very
				challenging. Together with their internal backend developers, I
				architectured and developed a frontend library to help them rebuild all
				of their apps and bring them to the web platform. In parallel, we also
				used the library to build <strong>realtime</strong> applications, such
				as trading clients now deployed and used by hundreds of traders
				throughout New York, Singapore and Frankfurt.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also worked on a product called
				<a href="https://fath.om/supergrid">Fathom SuperGrid</a>, which we
				developed internally and used on a variety of our clients.
			</p>

			<h2>R/GA</h2>
			<p>

				<a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">Beats by Dre</a>,
				<a href="http://www.pearson.com/">Pearson</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My work ranged from an entire education platform on web + iPad, static
				sites, a large–scale responsive e–commerce website, or an
				<a
					href="https://www.rga.com/work/case-studies/nike-immortalize-the-moment"
				>
					interactive installation
				</a>
				for the 2012 Olympics, to mobile–first web apps.

			<h2>Orange R&D</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.orange.com">Orange</a> is a big telco group in
				Europe.

			<h3>Frontend developer / October 2007 — May 2010 / Paris</h3>
